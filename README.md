# Satellite-Tracking
This repository contains:
- The code of my web services project.
- The explanatory video: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eFh51axzYUM5LV0vXxqfTeXdZbX8mIFH?usp=drive_link
- The LaTex report: https://fr.overleaf.com/read/xjmnhkvmgzkw#5ec19a 
- The Beamer Slides: https://fr.overleaf.com/read/xvgykszfmvwr#f513a2
  (There was an issue in this link. Apparently, I pasted two different links at the same time, but this one works perfectly).


Please note that when setting up the virtual environment locally, we should take into consideration the fact that the outer django app is satellite_tracker while the inner app is tracker. Both applications were added as zip files in order to make the process more user friendly.You can download all the zip files in order to have access to the code.
